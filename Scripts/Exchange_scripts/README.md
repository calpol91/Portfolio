## Exchange Modification Scripts

This collection of scripts is primarily used for day-to-day Exchange management tasks, especially for batch operations like adding users to mailboxes and distribution lists.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These scripts are actively used but currently a bit messy — improvements are ongoing.

### 🔧 Interactive Script

Originally created as a personal challenge, the **interactive script** has turned out to be quite handy. It allows for quick, manual adjustments when you're already connected to Exchange via PowerShell and just need to make a small change without running full batch jobs.

### ✅ Check Delegations

The `Check_delegations` script offers a quick way to verify if a user has delegated access to another mailbox. It's a simple and effective tool for permission checks.

### 📄 Reference Files

Some scripts rely on a reference file — typically a plain text file with user email addresses. These are used for batch operations like adding or removing users in bulk.
