## AD Scripts

> ⚠️ **Note:** Active Directory scripting is currently on hold due to ongoing infrastructure changes.

The company is in the process of migrating laptops from a primarily on-premises Active Directory environment to a global Azure/Intune/Entra tenant.

My current daily user account and laptop are joined to the cloud tenant, with access to the local AD only available through **RSAT tools**.

As a result, while I still use Active Directory daily, I have not actively developed or maintained any AD-related scripts during this transition period.
