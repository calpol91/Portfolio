## Welcome to My Portfolio

### About Me

For the past year, I have been working as an **IT Support Analyst** at a company based in the UK. I made the transition to this role after spending **17 years as an electrician**, driven by a strong desire to move into the field of **cybersecurity**.

Technology has always been a passion of mine. Even during my time as an electrician, I frequently took on tasks that would typically fall under the responsibilities of a **network engineer** — from configuring small office networks to troubleshooting connectivity issues. This hands-on experience sparked a deeper interest in IT infrastructure and security.

### My Transition to IT

Switching careers after nearly two decades in a different industry was a big step, but it has been incredibly rewarding. Over the past year, I’ve gained valuable experience in:

- End-user support (hardware & software)
- Troubleshooting network and connectivity issues
- Active Directory and user account management
- Microsoft 365 and cloud-based tools
- Working within ITIL-based service desk environments

My practical, real-world problem-solving skills — honed during my years as an electrician — have translated well into the IT field, especially when it comes to diagnostics and working under pressure.

### My Goals

I’m now focused on advancing my skills in **cybersecurity**, with particular interest in:

- Threat detection and response
- Network security
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing - TryHackMe and HackTheBox member 
- Security best practices and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)

I'm currently studying for relevant certifications to support this goal, including:

- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA Network+

### Let’s Connect

I’m always open to networking with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities to grow. Whether you're a fellow IT enthusiast, hiring manager, or security expert — feel free to reach out!
